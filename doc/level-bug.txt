Documentation on the Level Bug from Y3110W

Steps to reproduce:
1) reset your skill points in your race
2) change class so the menu appears
3) don't put any points in
4) type 'retry' in console
5) make sure the database has skills still at 0, if not then go back to step 1
6) reset again
7) spend your skill points in just one skill
8) kill yourself
9) while dead, reset again
10) repeat 7, 8 and 9
11) to save it, retry again

After the fix levels script is run, it converts the extra upgrades into levels

-------
Some Ideas:

Need to look closely at ResetUpgradesNow and ResetUpgrades starting at line 834

To detect this we'll need to run a query into the DB where we look to see if the
race level is lower than the sum of the race upgrades for a particular race
