hmm is this the exploit that gave overlord and carrier free lvl 4 jetpack ? well if that is the case ill have to admit i did use it when i used those races , but honestly i didn't really feel it was wrong. but if thats how jiggly or yourself feels and keeps the lvl's gone the script took could u when u have some free time delete my account please don't think i have the option and and other traces of me no use in it taking up space.

thanks X002

ps: omegalist hold in tenticle summon ultralisk use to give u a one shot tenticle that don't think would run outa energy and could grap teamates not that i used it but ran into it more than twice once figered out along my journeys here . oh while im at it i use to use the borrow heal glitch that let u have a super long heal beam till it was said was not allowed and energy trick from ghost for a free 150 start for prism guess its in my nature to use these things feels like tricks of the trade i pick up . Anyhow thanks for coding an awsome mod for tf2 it was a pleaser playing it mabe ill get to play some other cool mod u make for anther game i like in the future or tf3 . let Peace be with U oh and some advise if your anything like me and game too much don't forget to take some time out for the important things in life. oh and it seems u can reset armor on summoned classes any time u get a moment out of combat not sure if its intinded . bye
