Bugs:

2. The disappearance of the xp bonus for melee kills. For some reason the xp bonus for melee kills is gone, however all the other xp bonuses are still in the mod.

3. Protoss ultimate is disabled.

4. Reaver scarabs and lockdown sometimes stop working during the map and will not work for the next 40 minutes or so. For reaver scarabs this usually happens at the beginning of the map after the player has used this ability for more than 2 maps in a row, reaver scarabs will usually come back at the end of the map. I honestly don't know any of the symptoms for lockdown stopping, since I personally have not used them.

5. Zerg adrenal glands will work on any weapon if the player dies before their shot hits. For example, I shoot a pipe bomb and as its in the air I die, adrenal glands will work on that pipe bomb if it hits someone.

6. Nuclear missile works, however it randomly hits a spot on the map no matter where its launched from. It does kill people.

7.  Fix/Remove the autostacker.

8. never ending re-spawn in sudden death. The never ending re-spawn in sudden death is someone buying a scroll of re-spawning before dying each time.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
I have a few item suggestions:
1) Armor-piercing ammo (20-30 crystals) -- Reduces the benefit of Terran's Heavy Armor (could apply to other future classes with armor).
2) Sentry jammer (~75-100 crystals) -- Allows the owner to walk by enemy sentries without them firing upon them.
3) Flak Jacket (20-30 crystals) -- Reduces the damage received from 'explosions' (suicide bomber, mad bomber, reaver scarabs)
4) Flame retardant suit (75-100 crystals) -- Reduces fire damage and/or makes you as flammable as a normal pyro (ie, you burn, but you don't continue to burn).
5) ***Reduction in cost for Cloak of Shadows, 55 crystals is too high to prevent decloak, 20-30 crystals seems reasonable

I could add a few to that although I don't know if some of these are possible:
Instant Sentry (100 crystals), allows a level 3 Sentry Gun to be build in front of who ever buys it, no matter if they are an engi or not.

Instant Uber (100 crystals), allows a medic to have a full charge uber upon purchasing this item.

Super sappers (50-65 crystals) gives the spy sappers a supercharge, allowing them to destroy engineer equipment 2x as fast.
Unstable Mana Potion (80 Crystals) - You lose 2% of your health every second but your attacks do 100% more damage

Orb of Fire (35 Crystals) - If you manage to hit the enemy, they catch on fire for 3 seconds

I was able to find much of the variables such as m_flMaxSpeed and m_nModelIndex while playing with some cheat on that showed a whole load of text and data that was constantly changing. I even found the name for the Cloak meter for not just spy but all classes as for some reason Valve has all of them set at a max of 100 this is how it showed on screen (or at least close to it)

m_flCloakMeter float (100.000000) <-- and this value would decrease at a rate of 10/second until it reached zero then trigering the regeneration of 3.3/second. I know that the rates are changeable by convars and I was wondering how to add cheats to an admins lap without requiring sv_cheats to be set to "1". I have used BeetlesMod and have no problem and if I could do this on there I probably would since I find it more beginner friendly than SourceMod but I am a fast learner when it comes to coding.


 Sweet TF2 entity tools.

CODE
Launch TF2
Start a multiplayer server
sv_cheats 1
developer 2
build a sentry gun
place the x-hair over the sentry gun and type ent_text
This will show a good bit of info about that entity. This works for any entity in game.


CODE
You can also use
dtwatchent
This command will show you all the variables of an entity that get updated.
Using the ent_text above get the entity index number.
For an example lets say the sentry gun entity index is 12
I would run the command like this
dtwatchent 12

It will fill the console with all the changes and names of variables. You can use source mod to modify those variables.

bugs:
*Fixed*1. Human Alliance levels do not save. At the start of each new map human alliance players lose all of their levels but their overall level saves, not only does this make it a pain in the ass to play as human but it also creates a leveling exploit.
