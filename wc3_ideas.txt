I was able to find much of the variables such as m_flMaxSpeed and m_nModelIndex while playing with some cheat on that showed a whole load of text and data that was constantly changing. I even found the name for the Cloak meter for not just spy but all classes as for some reason Valve has all of them set at a max of 100 this is how it showed on screen (or at least close to it)

m_flCloakMeter float (100.000000) <-- and this value would decrease at a rate of 10/second until it reached zero then trigering the regeneration of 3.3/second. I know that the rates are changeable by convars and I was wondering how to add cheats to an admins lap without requiring sv_cheats to be set to "1". I have used BeetlesMod and have no problem and if I could do this on there I probably would since I find it more beginner friendly than SourceMod but I am a fast learner when it comes to coding.
