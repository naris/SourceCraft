After some tests here are some known bugs.

All of the following items/skills do not work.

Mask of Death
Boots of Speed
Invisibility --> Varies from person to person sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt work. (May not be bugged)
Unholy aura
Sock of the Feather
Critical Grenade?? (Tried on Demoman with no results)

All of the following skills/items DO work.
Mole
Periapt of Health.
Levitation -- Was working on all classes. Then I switched to scout, it worked and was CRAZY, then all of a sudden it stopped working on any class.
Thorns Aura
Trueshot aura
Vampiric Aura

I was able to find much of the variables such as m_flMaxSpeed and m_nModelIndex while playing with some cheat on that showed a whole load of text and data that was constantly changing. I even found the name for the Cloak meter for not just spy but all classes as for some reason Valve has all of them set at a max of 100 this is how it showed on screen (or at least close to it)

m_flCloakMeter float (100.000000) <-- and this value would decrease at a rate of 10/second until it reached zero then trigering the regeneration of 3.3/second. I know that the rates are changeable by convars and I was wondering how to add cheats to an admins lap without requiring sv_cheats to be set to "1". I have used BeetlesMod and have no problem and if I could do this on there I probably would since I find it more beginner friendly than SourceMod but I am a fast learner when it comes to coding.
