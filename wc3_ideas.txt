I was able to find much of the variables such as m_flMaxSpeed and m_nModelIndex while playing with some cheat on that showed a whole load of text and data that was constantly changing. I even found the name for the Cloak meter for not just spy but all classes as for some reason Valve has all of them set at a max of 100 this is how it showed on screen (or at least close to it)

m_flCloakMeter float (100.000000) <-- and this value would decrease at a rate of 10/second until it reached zero then trigering the regeneration of 3.3/second. I know that the rates are changeable by convars and I was wondering how to add cheats to an admins lap without requiring sv_cheats to be set to "1". I have used BeetlesMod and have no problem and if I could do this on there I probably would since I find it more beginner friendly than SourceMod but I am a fast learner when it comes to coding.


 Sweet TF2 entity tools.

CODE
Launch TF2
Start a multiplayer server
sv_cheats 1
developer 2
build a sentry gun
place the x-hair over the sentry gun and type ent_text
This will show a good bit of info about that entity. This works for any entity in game.


CODE
You can also use
dtwatchent
This command will show you all the variables of an entity that get updated.
Using the ent_text above get the entity index number.
For an example lets say the sentry gun entity index is 12
I would run the command like this
dtwatchent 12

It will fill the console with all the changes and names of variables. You can use source mod to modify those variables.
