		"en"		"Overlords were evolved from the Gargantis proximae, a faction of giant space-faring and semi-intelligent creatures. Once assimilated they were used to help cerebrates control and coordinate their broods and scout using their enhanced senses. Advanced strains may carry other zerg within hollows in their hides. Despite resembling the Portuguese man-o-war of Earth, they are fairly docile creatures that in addition to their leadership duties, tend to young larvae and transport other zerg across the depths of space by carrying them within their shelled bodies.  Overlords fly using helium-filled gas sacs combined with a weak telekinetic psi-ability for lift and motive power. They are protected by an exoskeleton, strong enough to resist a lightning strike."
