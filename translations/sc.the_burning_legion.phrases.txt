		"en"		"The Burning Legion (a.k.a. the great burning shadow, the Legion of the Lower Planes, or simply The Legion) is a vast, innumerable army of demons, infernals, and corrupted races who seek to destroy any trace of order in the universe. They have thrice invaded Azeroth, and were only beaten back at a terrible cost. Much of Azeroth's history  including the First, Second, and Third War were due to the Legion's influence. It should also be noted that Azeroth is the only known planet that they have ever failed to conquer.\nThe Legion's mission is, in theory, to undo the works of the titans and restore the universe back to its original, chaotic and disorganized state. In practice, the Legion scours all life, down to the last plant and mineral, from the worlds it invades. The Legion is thus responsible for the genocide of thousands of races across the universe billions, if not trillions of lives."
