		"en"		"The omegalisk is a zerg strain derived from the brontolith, similar to the ultralisk. It lacks the ultralisk's hardened exoskeletal shell. However, it does have large, bone-like kaiser blades similar to what the Ultralisks originally possesed. Additionally, they also have spiked tentacles, that can can be used to skewer opponents, that the ultralisks lack. The omegalisk is smaller than ultrlisk, being only 10 meters long and 3 meters high. Also, like most other zerg breeds, omegalisks are able to burrow underground which concels them from all opponents without detection abilities."
