		"en"		"Firebats are \"armored assault troopers\". Firebats are often attached to provide support for marine squads.  They are typically armed with dual arm-mounted flame throwers and wear armor similar to those used by marines, except heavier and providing additional resistance to heat and flame.\nDuring the Great War, Confederate firebats were equipped with wrist mounted Perdition flamethrowers and CMC-660 combat suits. The vulnerable flame tanks are protected by containment fields. United Earth Directorate firebats were armed with the C-140 Epyon Plasma Incinerator Cannon.\nAs with marines, many firebats were recruited or conscripted from \"culturally challenged\" persons. Such individuals underwent \"neural resocialization\" and received aggression inhibitor implants as part of their training. In the Confederate Marine Corps, an individual had to have a PEB (Preferred Experience Base) of at least three months combat experience to become a firebat."
