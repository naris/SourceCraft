		"en"		"Carriers are large, heavily armored and shielded warships that form the core of the protoss fleet, serving as command centers for fleet commanders. Although carriers lack weapon batteries or other armaments of any kind, their ability to unleash swarms of computer controlled interceptors makes them devastating in ship to ship battle. In addition, the carrier's hangars can house Scout fighters and even Arbiters.  Carriers are capable of making jumps through warp space and can operate in both atmospheric and deep space conditions. When not on the bridge, a carrier commander is entitled to his/her own quarters.\nCarriers manufacture interceptors. When deployed the strike craft attack and retreat rapidly to the carrier for repairs and reinforcement. The details of the smooth orchestrated employment of carrier-borne interceptors is a matter of interest to terran scientists. Interceptors are fast, maneuverable, computer-guided strike craft. They may deploy to engage enemy strike craft or ground units. The plasma charges of a flight of interceptors may threaten to capital ships."
