		"en"		"The Infestor is a breed of Zerg that inflicts disease and chaos on its enemies through it's powerful biochemical abilities. It shares many characteristics with the Defiler and is likely a genetic offshoot of its predecessor. In addition to its similarities to the defiler this unit also has many new evolutions that are sure to instill fear into the enemies of the swarm. The Infestor does not possess any direct attacks, instead it uses its ability to produce terrifying organisms and bio-chemicals to wreak havoc and destruction upon its opponents.\nIts primary offensive ability is Disease. This ability is very similar to the defiler's Plague and is absolutely devastating against groups of weaker units.  The Infestor also has an Enduring Corruption ability that can be directed at enemy structures, instead of destroying them, it \"corrupts\" them. If that unit's health drops below a critical amount during this time, it becomes corrupted, regardless of which unit landed the final blow. The Infestor can also launch Swarm Infestation, which sends a cloud of spores that tear apart enemies to a distant area."
