		"en"		"The SCV is used to construct and maintain everything from remote outposts to space platforms as well as harvest resources. They are used throughout the Koprulu Sector for their versatility and reliability. The T-280 SCV was widely adopted and became a staple in terran engineering by 2489. The T-280 stands just over three meters tall. It is equipped with fusion cutters and plasma welders. It is also used for general reconstruction efforts. During the reign of the Terran Confederacy, volunteering to pilot an SCV appeared to be an alternative to military service. The PEB (Preferred Experience Base) was hostile environment engineering, with combat experience a plus."
