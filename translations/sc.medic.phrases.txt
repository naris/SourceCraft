		"en"		"Historically Confederate marines suffered high casualties, but retained their strength through aggressive recruitment practices. Confederate medics remain at bases to care for wounded soldiers but are sometimes attached to squads/platoons. Confederate medics have a distinct appearance (white armor with a red cross). Raynor's Raiders medics operate on the front lines, at least on some occasions.  As conflict escalated to include the protoss and zerg, marine losses became prohibitive.\nThe United Earth Directorate pacification fleet includes combat medics in its front lines. Recruitment for medics drew in mostly women.  The UED's technological prowess includes the field of medical science. Medic tools have been expanded to chemical modifiers increasing marine survival rates and the use of nano-conveyed anesthetic and attenuated lasers to carry out on-site surgery. However, casualties will still occur and for dying marines, medics administer a drug known as the \"Final Protocol\".\nDespite their armor and arm-mounted shields, medics are still vulnerable. Generally, their only armament is the A-13 flash grenade launcher, which is used to provide illumination and 'blind' enemy targets. The Alliance's medics use the C-7 gauss pistol and wear CMC-405 light combat suits.  Following the Brood War, the Koprulu Sector factions continue to use medics but only sparingly, having replaced them with the medivac dropship."
