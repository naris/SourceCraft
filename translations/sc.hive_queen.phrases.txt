		"en"		"The Hive Queen is the Zerg breed that has gone through the most changes since the Brood War, and is now one of the most important units of the Zerg Swarm.  After the demise of the Cerebrates, Kerrigan made the fragile flying Queens into deadly ground-based defenders of the Hive Cluster. These improved Hive Queens reign over the cluster, and provide several defensive benefits to them. Unlike other creatures of the swarm, the Hive Queen is birthed directly from a Hatchery, bypassing the usual morphing. The Hive Queen is able to evolve alongside the Hive Cluster, retaining her power. However, if the Hive Queen is killed the swarm will lose all of her accompanying upgrades and the new Hive Queen will have to re-upgrade. Suffice to say, the Zerg must be very protective of their Queens. The Hive Queen can dig deep tunnels between Zerg outposts, a very powerful ability. The Queen is also capable of making the very creep toxic to enemy units."
