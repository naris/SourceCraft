		"en"		"Probes are robotic drones controlled by an artificial intelligence. They were originally designed by the Khalai Caste to lay the foundation for protoss colonies on hostile worlds where living workers would be at too great a risk. Even after the Brood War, it is not uncommon to see hundreds of probes lining the streets of a protoss settlement, performing one task or another.  The probe truly shines in its service to protoss military might, providing service to the nexus of any protoss base. They are also used to warp in structures, manufacturing and planting micro-beacons, allowing fully functional buildings to be warped in over interstellar distances. Although this is their primary function, probes can still construct facilities from scratch, along with harvesting resources, courtesy of their in-built particle beam.  Probes are occasionally used as scouts and if the situation calls for it, a last line of defense."
