		"en"		"The United Auto Workers (UAW) are the restless spirits of those who never had a chance to achieve greatness in life. A vaporous gray mist clearly forms the skeletal body of these creatures. Their vaguely humanoid bodies are translucent and leaves a misty trail as they glide silently about. Only the bright violet eyes, which burn with great intensity, look as though they have any substance. These utterly invisible, incorporeal creatures prefer to avoid living beings.\nThey seem content to roam the land where they were spawned, but most seem also equally at ease among other undead. Poor combatants, the UAW prefer to avoid fighting or working as much as possible and tend to hide in bathrooms. They would rather flee than face an enemy they cannot hope to defeat, but they also tend to retreat from creatures they could likely defeat. When forced into battle, they attempt to hamper the living as much as possible, but still seek to fly away at the first opportunity. Cornered UAW will fight to the death, but note that incorporeal creatures are notoriously hard to corner."
