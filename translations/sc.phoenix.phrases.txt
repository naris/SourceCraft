Phoenix patrols are a common sight on the outer rim of protoss territory, where they sweep deep space for alien threats. The twin ion blaster armament of a Phoenix is highly suited to air-to-air combat.  Amoung the Phoenix's armaments is the Graviton Beam, which is an Anti-Gravity that can lift enemy units into the air. Such units then lose their ability to attack.  However, when the phoenix uses this ability, it is rendered unpowered and is also unable to attack, Other units must attack the target.  The Anti-Gravity ability is very useful in taking key enemy units out of commission and it cannot target massive units.  Burrowed zerg units will be unburrowed by the ability, and will reburrow when they fall back to the ground."
