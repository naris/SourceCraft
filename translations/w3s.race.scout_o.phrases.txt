After the alliance with the Beast Horde, they learned yet more ways of the wild, and turned all their craft to defeating the Hellbourne. Though many view them as aloof, none doubt the importance of Scouts in the war against the daemons, as the countless enemy corpses, dead by a single blow, attest."
