		"en"		"The Titty Hunter is a lumbering, rotting corpse that has made the final transition into true undeath. He has great stamina, revels in combat with living beings and is a ravenous cannibal who devours the flesh of fallen warriors, friend and foe alike. He is also a cunning hero, adept at manipulating opponents. Forcibly raised from the dead, he enjoys nothing more than sowing dissension and hatred within the enemy ranks. The Titty Hunter is a silent stalker of shadows, felling unsuspecting opponents with a single arrow. He still favors the bow as the ultimate weapon, using the same arts that Quel'Thalas taught for millennia. His spells work with manipulating the essences of life and death, as well as various horrible curses and mind-enslaving abilities.  The Titty Hunter strikes fear and woe into the hearts of even the most resolute defenders."
