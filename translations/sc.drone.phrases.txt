Over time they became drones, engineered with the larvae's ability to break down their own genetic coding and transform themselves into rudimentary zerg structures. A transforming drone needs creep to provide nourishment and mass to support its new form.  Like the larva, drones are controlled by overlords who monitor their progress. Drones are usually single-minded about their tasks, diligently working through even raging combat.  Drones possess limited combat ability, but in a swarm, they can present a significant threat, attacking with claws and spines."
