		"en"		"The battlecruiser is a type of terran capital ship employed in the Koprulu Sector. The Behemoth-class battlecruiser is armed with lasers, protected by neosteel armor and equipped with Gravity accelerators, featuring the ability to travel through warp space, operate within planetary atmospheres and even land on planets. Armament consists of multiple burst laser batteries and a complement of nuclear warheads.  Despite the heavy arsenal, Behemoth armament is slightly constricted in that its laser batteries cannot fire at targets to the side and its warheads are reserved for orbital bombardment rather than space combat. A saving grace for the Behemoth-class exists in the form of the Yamato Cannon. The Yamato Gun's primary weakness is its huge energy requirements and while the installation of a colossus reactor allows for increased energy storage, it is not a long term solution.\nDespite its shortcomings, the Behemoth-class has proven to be an enduring design, keeping up to date with periodic upgrades while its hammerhead design had provided the basis for future classes. Although more advanced classes of battlecruiser have been developed, the Behemoth-class continues to remain in service."
