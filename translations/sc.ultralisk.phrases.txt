		"en"		"The ultralisk is a 20 meter long and 5 meter high living battering ram, evolved from the docile brontolith; a creature that the ultralisk now bears little resemblance to. Ultralisks serve as the backbone of the Swarm, possessing an exceptionally thick carapace.  Ultralisks attack using large, bone-like scythes which protrude from their backs. Known as \"kaiser blades\", these scythes are nearly indestructible. Possessing monomolecular edges, these scythes are able to tear through most substances with ease.\nEven during the conflict, ultralisk evolution continued. By 2500 at least some ultralisks sported four kaiser blades as opposed to the usual two. By the Brood War, prolonged exposure to vespene gas had resulted in an enhancement to the ultralisks' physical capabilities, among which was the evolution of a more hardened exoskeletal shell and the ability to carry out anabolic synthesis, alterations being made to the glands that produce endorphins and adrenal fluids."
