		"en"		"The Terran Raven, formerly known as the Nighthawk, Vulkan and the TF-620 Nomad, is a versatile craft which combines the functions of a light manufacturing center and observation post. A common sight amongst the colonies of the Fringe Worlds, the Raven is built to operate in all but the harshest climates. Although the Raven shares a number of common traits with the SCV (its smaller 'cousin'), the Raven is a far more specialized and advanced engineering craft.\nRavens are normally employed for first-line colony surveillance and protection duties against dangerous local life forms or climate events. These vehicles boast a wide array of sensors delicate enough to detect even cloaked or burrowed enemies. By deploying its two aft-mounted nano-welders, the Raven can construct a variety of small, semi-permanent defensive structures to meet various threats in a matter of moments.  Several standard template constructions are available to the Raven, a popular example being the auto-turret.  The Terran Dominion initially provided Raven to give low-level protection to its most isolated outposts, typically manning them with local civilians as something akin to a volunteer fire truck or ambulance service. Over time the military support applications of the Raven have seen it deployed in escalating levels of conflict, gradually replacing the older and vastly costlier science vessel."
