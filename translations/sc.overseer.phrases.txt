		"en"		"The Zerg incorporated Overlords into the Swarm by assimilating the giant space-faring and semi-intelligent Gargantis proximae and used them to help Cerebrates control and coordinate their Broods, as well as taking the role of scouts, using their enhanced senses. The Overlords have been used for scouting, detection, and transportation in the past, but the Zerg has let a genetic strain of the Overlord develop independently, creating the Overseer, which has specialized in scouting and detection, combating the increased advancement for cloaking  enemies.\nOverseers will also be able to increase the fine-tuning of their senses if they have time to concentrate, increasing their effective sight range. Their ability to detect units will remain more limited, but the Zerg still take great advantage of this increased ability to notice incoming opponents long before they notice the Swarm.\nOverseers use the same type of flying and movement as Overlords using helium-filled gas sacs combined with a weak telekinetic psi-ability for lift and movement."
