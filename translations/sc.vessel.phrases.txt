		"en"		"In use since at least 2478, the terrans of the Koprulu Sector built Explorer vessels to conduct a wide range of research and development projects, stationed at points throughout the Koprulu Sector and beyond to study anomalous phenomena. In addition, the Confederacy's Epsilon Squadron used Explorers extensively for border surveillance and study.  When contact with the protoss and zerg devolved into open warfare many Explorers were requisitioned by military authorities to provide electronic warfare and support for forces in the field, along with aiding the research and development of new weapons and technologies.\nThe primary function of the science vessel is the employment of its detection abilities. Other functions, with the appropriate equipment, include the creation of a Defensive Matrix, the generation of a short ranged EMP (alternatively this can be detonated at a distance via the launching of a warhead) and Irradiation. For increased energy output, a Titan Reactor can be installed. All science vessels possess Ghost Program files, stored in a secure room at the bottom of the vessel, in case a ghost requires \"repair\" (what ammounts to medical aid in the program).  After the Brood War the Terran Dominion substituted the Raven for the expensive science vessel in the battlefield support role."
