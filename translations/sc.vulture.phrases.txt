		"en"		"In use by 2478, the vulture is a lightly-armored one-man hoverbike primarily used for scouting and patrol, designed with speed and reliability in mind. Its limited gravity hover technology allows the bike to travel over rough terrain with little loss of traction or speed, and reach speeds up to 230 miles per hour; an onboard computer and sensors mounted in the \"nose\" of the craft keep it at a steady pace for most of the time. These features make the vulture suitable for patrolling the vast wildernesses typically found around terran colonies. They produce a humming whine as they move.\nVultures are ill suited for heavy combat, given their light frame. However, they make excellent skirmishers, especially against lightly armored targets. In some occasions, vultures may be formed into small squadrons, usually attached to mechanized infantry. Given the speed at which the bikes move however, it is difficult to maintain cohesion. The vulture's driver seat can be enclosed depending on model, customization, or operating environment and can be configured for someone to ride shotgun.\nIn the Confederate Armored Vehicle Corps, aspiring vulture pilots have to pass a minimal physical fitness exam before becoming a pilot. Originally, the standard Vulture armament was an anti-personnel APG-2 \"Thumper\" Grenade Launcher. Since the Brood War however, may instead be equipped with a mounted laser cannon. Other optional equipment includes spider mines and ion thrusters."
