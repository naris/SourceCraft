		"en"		"The first archon(s) were created unexpectedly and their formation was soon legally sanctioned by Khala.  The creation of an archon is a serious affair for it requires the reluctant sacrifice of valuable high templar for a short-term gain. Archons radiate energy like stars and burn out when depleted. The merging results in the abandonment of the physical form and the loss of self, but those who do so are bequeathed great honor and a place in the templar archives. The loss of most of the psionic powers of the two merging templar is more than compensated for by the archon's formidable psychic gestalt. Archons can independently erect a resilient shield and direct psionic shockwaves.  Emotionally, archons are manifestations of pure rage, though this may be \"twisted\" should the merging be in error.  After the Brood War and the reunification of the protoss, archons can now also be created by merging dark templar with their high templar brethren."
