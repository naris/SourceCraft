		"en"		"The fall of Aiur demonstrated to the Dark Templar that more than just stealth and guile were required to defeat the zerg. Hence, the Dark Templar developed the disrupter, a war machine inspired by the Khalai  dragoon. While dragoons were piloted by crippled protoss, the disrupter was controlled by the shadow-essence of a Dark Templar warrior fused into a metal body. The new walkers were armed with carapace-mounted particle disruptors adept against both ground and aerial targets.\nDisrupters were credited with many fantastic powers upon their battlefield debut. However, only one was witnessed consistently: an ability to instantly teleport, or \"blink\", from one spot to another. The improved mobility thus granted allowed the disrupter to conduct ambushes, catch fleeing foes, and generally engage on their own terms."
