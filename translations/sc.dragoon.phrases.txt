Within a short time, the fallen warriors learn to control the movements of the large, mechanical walker as naturally as if they were within their former bodies. Dragoons provide essential supporting fire for the Zealot cyberneticions by launching bolts of anti-particles sheathed in a psychically charged field. These disintegration bolts are effective against both air and ground targets."
